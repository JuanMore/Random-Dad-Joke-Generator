# Random-Dad-Joke-Generator API
This simple app is designed to generate a random dad joke using the random dad joke api. It was designed with basic, html, css and javascript utilizing Bulma. I had a great time creating this as it involved some problem solving. I ran into a few bugs regarding api inegration, however with some simple research online I got it all to work and put it all together with Bulma styling. Let me know what you think!
